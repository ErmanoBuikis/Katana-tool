My project is based on the development of an IT algorithm suitable for operating in the financial markets.
The algorithm uses the combination of: Artificial Intelligence, in particular Neural Networks
and Genetic Algorithms for machine learning, in addition to using Statistics and Financial Mathematics 
for the study of market movements and the creation of predictive models. The algorithm is able to generate 
rules for opening, closing and managing the size of individual positions in the markets.
The algorithm was designed to operate on all types of markets that have data for machine learning,
from Forex to commodities, up to the stock market. The higher cost is required for the presence 
of a processor with great computing capacity for the application of artificial intelligence in a short time, 
in addition to the continuous learning required by the operator. In my opinion, creative and innovative methods,
not seen elsewhere, are used in the use and generation of complex mathematical formulas and related strategies.
My dream is to be able to give this Algorithm for Automated Trading at a low (or free) cost to anyone who decides 
to invest in financial markets, without having to know the rules, cutting down the costs of an intermediary.
The will is to create a tool to revolutionize the financial market and to be able to give an individual investment weapon.
The strength of the algorithm lies in the fact that it can generate, each time the program is launched,
rules for: entering, positioning and closing operations, in a different way, as well as different strategies.
This last fact allows to have different types of risk management based on the preferences of the investor.
